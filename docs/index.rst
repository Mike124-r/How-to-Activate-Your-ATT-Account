This guide will show you how to activate your account, deal with typical problems, and get the most out of your AT&T digital experience.

Why it's important to activate your ATT account
Your AT&T account is the hub for all the services you utilize. Activation verifies your identity, connects your services to your profile, and lets you manage your account using AT&T's website or mobile app.

If you don't finish activation:

You won't be able to get to or change your services.

You won't be able to use online features like AutoPay or usage monitoring.

Customer service may not be able to see your account records.

Your devices or SIMs might not work the way you want them to.

Activation makes sure you are completely connected and supported.

When Should You Activate Your ATT Account?
There are a few times when you need to activate:

New customers: signing up for the first time

New Device or SIM Card: Changing phones or tablets

Changing a Plan or Service

Changing from Prepaid to Postpaid

Changing your address with AT&T Internet or TV

To integrate your services and account information, each of these needs a simple activation process.
